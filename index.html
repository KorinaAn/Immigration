        <h2>Welcome to our website about US immigration data!</h2>
        <p>Immigration to the United States has fluctuated over the past 20 years. In the early 2000s, immigration to the US increased significantly, driven in part by a rise in the number of people coming from Latin America, particularly Mexico. However, since the late 2000s, the number of people immigrating to the US has decreased slightly.

        In recent years, the Trump Administration implemented a number of policies aimed at reducing immigration to the US, including stricter border controls, the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and the implementation of a travel ban targeting several majority-Muslim countries. These policies have likely contributed to a decrease in immigration to the US in recent years.

        It's worth noting that while the overall number of immigrants coming to the US may have decreased slightly in recent years, the demographics of immigrants to the US have changed. For example, in recent years there has been an increase in the number of immigrants coming to the US from Asian countries, particularly China and India. There has also been an increase in the number of immigrants coming to the US from African countries. </p>

        <p> We see the number of people who became immigrants in 2021 in different US states as follows: </p>
